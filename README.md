## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The carousel container adapts its size dynamically to fit different screen sizes.
- **Navigation Buttons:** Users can navigate between reviews using "PREV" and "NEXT" buttons.
- **Content Overflow Handling:** Ensures that content remains within the container and adjusts to various zoom levels.
